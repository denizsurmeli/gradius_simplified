### Game Dynamics
When you start to play, the game has certain mechanics to regulate the game.
  * In your first five seconds, there are no enemies or bullets towards you, so you can prepare yourself.
  * After five seconds, and every five seconds after that,there are regular asteroids and enemy ships, which you can take them down by hitting them with your bullet.
  * After ten seconds from the beginning, and every ten seconds after that, there are strong asteroids and shooting enemies, which you can't take them down with one hit using your regular bullet. There are two choices which are:
    * If have gathered a strong bullet(we will come to them in a minute) you can take them down with one hit.
    * If you are shooting the regular bullets, you have to hit three times to destroy the objects.
  * The strong bullets are gathered by taking down strong asteroids and shooting enemies. When you fire a strong bullet and hit an object:
    * Whether the target is a strong type or not, the enemy gets destroyed.
    * Nearby enemies in a small radius are damaged also:
      * If they are regular enemies, they get destroyed.
      * If they are strong enemies, they are effected as if they got hit by regular bullets. 
      
  * If you don't destroy the strong asteroids before they reach out to the left of the screen, you lose the game.
  * Be aware, shooting enemies come towards you and they shoot bullets. You are eliminated after three bullet hits. 
  * When you kill regular and shooting enemies, you are gathering some points. Every 5 points, you are rewarded with a nuclear ability,which is:
    * When you press shift; every enemy,whether they are strong or not, they get destroyed immediately. 
  * Your score is governed by the targets you have killed, so try to eliminate as much as you can. 
  
And lastly, have fun!
